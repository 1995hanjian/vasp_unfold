=============

v1.0

* Added the possiblity to parse the PROCAR file from the
  non-collinear spin-polarized calculation.

* Added the possibility to unfold both spin up and spin
  down components.
  

Jan 28th 2015
=============

v1.1

* Refactored code into separate files. App can be packed 
  into single executable with pack.sh script. 
  
* Spin polarized and non-collinear PROCARS are now fully 
  parsed.

=============

v1.2

* Can handle vacancies and excess atoms not. One to one
  mapping check is now optional.
  

Aug 31st 2015
=============

v1.3

* Changed the way orbital weights are unfolded. Orbital
  weights from the non-collinear spin-polarized calculation
  are now fully unfolded.
  
* Added a small plotting utility to plot fatbands.

* File structure reorganized again.

* Added extended error message regarding broken PROCAR
  formatting.


Mar 4th 2016
=============

v1.31

* Fixed the output format for the unfolded PROCAR in the case
  of the non-collinear calculation.
